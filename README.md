# Spacestagram

Spacestagram allows users to view some of the most beautiful, highest fidelity photographs of outer space in the world. 

Spacestagram was built with React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Vanilla CSS. A few tools used in the construction of Spacestagram were axios, JSONWebTokens, and Figma.

Design files used to mockup Spacestagram for desktop, mobile, and tablet views can be found below:

Once initial mockups were created, I proceeded to create a simple backend API using Node, Express and MongoDB to support authentication and store photos that each user has liked in the past.
