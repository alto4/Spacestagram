# Spacestagram

# Spacestagram allows users to view some of the most beautiful, highest fidelity photographs of outer space in the world. 

# Spacestagram was built with React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Vanilla CSS. A few tools used in the construction of Spacestagram were axios, JSONWebTokens, and Figma.

# Design files used to mockup Spacestagram for desktop, mobile, and tablet views can be found below:
